//Here should be the actual code of fetching and extracting data from the about and videos pages of youtube. I was using the same approach you can find at https://github.com/DojoMadness/t-blondi. Scraping is not very efficient compared to consuming an API, but I was experimenting with that because it was already implemented on t-blondi and I think we may have to use this approach for other platforms (Twitch, Mixer) anyway
